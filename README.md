# Automated-Timetable-Generator
The time table in a work-based environment is critical and crucial for the company or the institution to function properly but in such a situation it is also very tedious process making one as it requires the need for a lot of manual inputs from the receiver and makes it a very tedious process. So, this is where the need for an Automated time table comes in. 

Automated time table is a ML based time table where it will directly assign the time table to the receiver based on certainly previously implemented/ acquired data but this too isnâ€™t friendly for the clients. Since, the Automated time table is a NP-complete problem. No perfectly executable solution exists but only optimal solutions. This rigidity makes them problematic.

We want to address this rigidity and want to make it friendly for the people in a longer run. 


The main features of our project deal with the following:
1.	It would generate a time table using ML techniques.
2.	The students would be able to give feedbacks for a better data set in timetable future generation.
3.	A certain amount required access would be provided to the admin and student.
4.	It would be an institution friendly reducing the unnecessary need for manual and time taking frameworks.
5.	Notification generation like an alarm so that the students know what is happening or about to happen.
